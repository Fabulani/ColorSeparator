Separates pens based on their color by use of a TCS3200 color sensor and a DC12V motor with a potenciometer attachment for angular position sensoring and controlling.

Main file for the project can be found in the MAIN folder. This file is responsible for everything.

"Files for testing components" is exactly what it sounds like. Inside this folder, there's 4 other folders with files for testing individual components. These files were also used for calibration purposes.
